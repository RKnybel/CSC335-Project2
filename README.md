# CSC335-Project2
Project 2 for Computer Algorithms. Use this testing code to help with your paper!

## How to use the program
1. Run the program from the command line
2. Type one capital letter to select a sorting algorithm.
3. Enter the lower bound of N. The program will increment N and run the sorting algorithm through a range of list sizes.
4. Enter the upper bound of N.
5. Enter the number of iterations. The program will reset N to the lower bound at the start of each iteration.
6. Type Y or N to decide whether to print the lists. If lists aren't printed, CSV is printed to the console for use in a spreadsheet.

## How to make your graph in excel
1. Copy Data. Use the left mouse button to select the N and time values, then right click to copy. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25082596/227084128-85189812-d80b-4ec7-b786-141b6c60b6a7.png)
2. Paste Data into Excel. Pick a cell and paste the data in. The time data still needs to be moved one cell to the right. 
3. Make sure all the data is selected like so. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25082596/227085540-c0b21198-346f-42a6-baf7-a4279fbc7dc3.png)
4. Select the Data tab on top and click "Text to Columns". In the dialog box, click next, make sure only comma is checked under delimiters, and click finish. The data will enter the cells the way they should. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25082596/227084720-5b4b4989-a422-48a7-a2a9-0783f5da936f.png)
5. Select just the microsecond values in your table, then insert a 2D line graph. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25082596/227085157-fb52a022-b892-4799-882b-50effceed0bc.png)

### I hope this program helps with the experiments for your papers. Good luck!
